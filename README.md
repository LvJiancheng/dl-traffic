Code for the "Deep Learning for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04527)

This data contains all the scripts that were used for the emperical results presented in the paper.

All of the data is stored on the Box and urls are used in the code.

The original (un-cleaned) data is stored here https://app.box.com/s/jgnto4zn1008965vuztjr9z2ignpj70m. extract_speed script reads the raw SQLite files and saves to RDS fales used later in the ananlysis.
